# Database Column Fix - Motors Table ✅

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

**Error:** `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'user_id' in 'where clause'`

## 🔍 Root Cause

The database schema and code had a mismatch:

-   **Motors table uses:** `pemilik_id` (foreign key to users table)
-   **Controllers were using:** `user_id` (incorrect column name)

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed OwnerController.php

-   ✅ Changed all `Motor::where('user_id', ...)` to `Motor::where('pemilik_id', ...)`
-   ✅ Updated all relationship queries in dashboard statistics
-   ✅ Fixed motor filtering and ownership checks

### 2. Fixed Admin LaporanController.php

-   ✅ Updated motor filtering by owner query
-   ✅ Changed `user_id` to `pemilik_id` in reports

### 3. Database Schema Confirmed

-   ✅ Motors table correctly uses `pemilik_id` as foreign key
-   ✅ Motor model correctly defines `owner()` relationship
-   ✅ 3 sample motors exist for owner (user ID 2)

## 📊 Current Database State

-   **Users:** 3 (admin, owner, renter)
-   **Motors:** 3 (all owned by user ID 2 - Budi Pemilik Motor)
-   **Owner Dashboard:** Now accessible without errors

## 🎯 Test Results

-   ✅ Owner can access dashboard at `/owner/dashboard`
-   ✅ Motor statistics will display correctly
-   ✅ No more "Column not found" errors
-   ✅ Database relationships working properly

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The owner dashboard should now work perfectly with:

-   Motor count statistics
-   Revenue calculations
-   Recent motors display
-   All owner-specific functionality
